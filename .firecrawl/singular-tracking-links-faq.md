**Singular Links FAQ**

Look for specific issues

**Tracking links** are triggered when a user views or clicks on one of your ads. They notify your attribution provider (MMP) of the view or click so the attribution provider can track mobile app installs and re-engagements.

**Singular Links** are an advanced tracking link solution that provides a friendly UI for creating and managing tracking links. You can choose the link behavior, attribution settings, and additional information to include in the link. Singular Links also automatically leverage iOS Universal Links and Android intent technology to create deep link**Deep Link**: A tracking link that not only opens the app (if it already exists on the user's mobile device) but also leads to a specific page or experience inside the app, e.g., a specific product in an e-commerce app. [Learn more](https://www.singular.net/glossary/deep-linking/)s whenever possible.

My Deeplink doesn't open my app, it sends me to the app store

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#deeplink_doesnt_open_app)

If your app doesn’t open when you click on a Singular link, the issue is usually one of the following:

1. **Missing Prerequisites in the App or Singular Dashboard:**   - Ensure your app meets the necessary prerequisites and configurations.
   - Check the detailed prerequisites guide here: [Singular Links Prerequisites](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360031371451).
2. **Incorrect Link Configuration:**   - Verify that the destinations are correctly set in the "Manage Links" page.
   - Follow the steps in this guide: [How to Create Deep Links](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050910891#Create_the_Link).

My Deferred Deeplink doesn't work when the app is installed

In cases where deeplinks work but deferred deeplinks don’t, The issue lies whether the Singular Links Handler implemented as per Singular's SDK best practices since we recommend initiating Singular SDK on **Open URL** and wherever app has entry points.

On iOS, a common issue in testing deferred deeplinks is Apple's Private Relay - make sure to turn it off in your test device via Settings > \[Name\] > iCloud > Advanced Data Protection > Private Relay:

What is a **tracking link**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#what_is_a_tracking_link)

When a user views or clicks on one of your ads, they activate a link that notifies your attribution provider of the view or click. The attribution provider uses this information to track mobile app installs and re-engagements. The link can include other information, which will eventually be displayed in your reports.

**» For more context about how tracking links enable attribution, see**[**Understanding Singular Mobile App Attribution**](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/115000526963)**.**

What are **Singular Links**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#what_are_singular_links)

Singular Links are Singular's tracking link solution, which lets you create and manage tracking links through a UI that walks you through all the available options for link behavior, attribution settings, and additional information to include in the link.

Singular Links automatically leverage iOS Universal Links and Android intent technology to create deep links whenever possible (see the [Prerequisites](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360031371451)).

Here is an example of a Singular Link. You can try it out on your iOS or Android device:

```auto
https://singularassist.sng.link/A59c0/nha7?_dl=singularassist%3A%2F%2F
```

**Note on legacy tracking links:** In the documentation, we use the terms "Singular Links" and "tracking links" interchangeably. Your account may still have access to Singular's legacy tracking link solution. To avoid confusion, these are referred to as "legacy tracking links."

What is a **redirect**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#what_is_a_redirect)

When a user clicks a regular link on the web, such as www.linkedin.com, the browser asks the URL's server (in this case, LinkedIn) what it should do, and in return, the URL's server gives the browser some HTML to display to the user.

When a user clicks a tracking link, the link provider's server tells the user's browser to go to a different URL instead (the redirect URL) and to serve the content from that URL. The redirection is usually performed via [HTTP 302](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302).

What is a **fallback redirect**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#what_is_a_fallback_redirect)

In the context of deep linking, a fallback redirect is a redirect destination that you want to take the user to if the deep link fails.

Typically, if a user clicks an ad for your app, you want the deep link to send them into a specific screen inside the app. But if the user doesn't already have the app installed, you want to redirect the user to the app store instead to download your app.

What are **deep links**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#what_are_deep_links)

[Deep links](https://www.singular.net/glossary/deep-linking/) are links that not only open the app on the user's device (if the user already has the app installed) but also show specific app content or a specific user experience instead of just opening the app's default screen.

Deep links drive returning users directly to the heart of your application, much like regular web links direct users to a specific page within a website. After doing a little leg work to implement deep links in your app, you can lead users straight into your app to a specific screen, or create customized experiences the moment they enter the app.

How do **deep links work**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#how_do_deep_links_work)

Developers have been using different methods to enable deep linking:

**Note:** Singular Links technology was developed with iOS and Android deep link trends in mind. When you generate a tracking link in Singular, the link is automatically enabled with the compatible deep linking technology, including [Apple Universal Links](https://www.singular.net/glossary/universal-links/), Android app links, and Android intent technology. In addition, the Singular SDK is designed to simplify the usage of deep links and deferred deep links. See the [Singular Links FAQ](http://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212) for more information.

1. **URI Schemes (e.g. "myapp://path/to/page?pageid=1"):** Also known as "app scheme" deep linking.  In this legacy deep linking method, the app developer registers a “scheme” for the app, so that the device platform knows it needs to open the app whenever a user clicks a link with that scheme - in our example, any link starting with “myapp://”.   - If the app is installed on the device, it opens, and then parses the rest of the link and shows the user a specific page within the app or delivers a specific experience accordingly.
   - If the app is not installed on the user’s device, this results in an error. There is no fallback URL.
2. **iOS Universal Links (iOS 9+):** This technology was developed to improve on URI-scheme-based deep linking on iOS. When using this technology, the app developer first sets up a verified web domain (e.g. "myapp.com") to serve Universal Links for an app. When a user clicks a Universal Link (e.g. "https://www.myapp.com/path/to/page?pageid=1"), the device platform knows it needs to open a specific app.   - If the app is installed on the device, it opens, and then parses the rest of the link and shows the user a specific page within the app or delivers a specific experience accordingly.
   - If the app is not installed, the user is taken seamlessly to the web URL, using the device’s default browser.
3. **Android App Links (Android 6.0+):** Android's improvement on URI-scheme-based deep linking. When using this technology, the app developer first sets up a verified web domain to serve App Links. When a user clicks an app link, the device platform knows it needs to open a specific app.   - If the app is installed on the device, it opens, and then parses the rest of the link and shows the user a specific page within the app or delivers a specific experience accordingly.
   - If the app is not installed, the user is taken seamlessly to the web URL, using the device’s default browser.

What are **deferred deep links**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#what_are_deferred_deep_links)

[Deferred deep linking](https://www.singular.net/glossary/deferred-deep-linking/) is another improvement on deep links. With this technology, if a user clicks on a deep link and does not have the app installed on their device, not only is the user directed to an app store, but the deep link parameters (what page or customized experience to show to the user) are actually not lost. If the user later installs the app from the app store and opens it, the app accesses the deep link parameters and shows the user the intended customized experience.

Unlike deep linking, deferred deep linking is generally only possible with the help of an **attribution tracker**:

1. The tracker collects information about pre-install clicks targeted for the mobile app.
2. The tracker’s SDK, implemented inside the app, can access that pre-install context.
3. The app uses the SDK to find out what deep link the user originally engaged with and serve the intended page or customized experience when the app is opened for the first time.

What causes deep linking to **fail**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#what_causes_deep_linking_to_fail)

Though deep linking is an incredibly useful way to engage with your user, to properly use it for your marketing channels, you should be familiar with its usage and limitations.

### Redirect Settings

**Make sure to set redirect=true.**

### Limitations of URI (App) Schemes

Using URI (app) schemes is generally not recommended, because if the app is not already installed on the user’s device, clicking a link will cause an error and drastically reduce user engagement.

On iOS, [URI scheme](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/inter-process_communication/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/defining_a_custom_url_scheme_for_your_app) deep linking may be the only way deep link the user in cases the preferred method, iOS Universal Links, may fail.  However, keep in mind that the end-user experience when using URI scheme deep linking are not ideal, and the user may see pop-ups depending on their default iOS browser:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| _**Examples of the User Experience with URI scheme deep linking on iOS**_ |
| ![mceclip0.png](https://support.singular.net/hc/article_attachments/13913959668251)<br>_User confirmation before deep linking_ | ![mceclip1.png](https://support.singular.net/hc/article_attachments/13913985099163)<br>_User pop-up "error" if app is not installed.  Upon clicking "OK", the user continues to the fallback destination_ |

**Note:** See the next section for common reasons for iOS Universal Link deep linking failing.

On Android, you can work around this by using [Android intents](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking) to direct the user to the Google Play store instead of being shown an error message.

In addition, URI-scheme deep linking has security vulnerabilities: other apps can register the same URI scheme as your app and hijack your deep links.

### Limitations of iOS Universal Links

- **Social Media Apps:** Some social media apps intentionally break or limit deep links that try to take the user out of the social media app. These are often social media apps that open links in an internal web browser view.
- **Link Wrapping:** Universal Links can’t work with link wrapping, where another URL redirects to the universal link. Link wrapping includes link shorteners such as bit.ly.
- **Pasting in Browser URL Field:** Universal Links will not deep link if you enter the link into a mobile browser's URL field.
- **Triggering Links with Javascript:** Scripts that trigger URL redirects will not deep link unless it is part of a user action.

What are **iOS Universal Links**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#what_are_ios_universal_links)

[Universal Links](https://www.singular.net/glossary/universal-links/) are Apple’s deep linking technology, designed to replace the older URI-scheme deep linking method. They are available for devices running iOS 9 and above.

While Universal Links allow for deep linking behavior similar to URI schemes, they function very differently behind the scenes. Universal Links look like normal HTTPS URLs, e.g. “https://www.linkedin.com”. When a user clicks a Universal Click, the user’s device opens the app that the link was configured for. If the app is not installed on the device, the user is taken to the actual URL in their mobile browser.

How do I **set up Universal Links for my app**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#setting_up_universal_links)

As an app developer, do the following to enable Universal Links in your app:

1. **Enable Associated Domains in Your Apple Developer Account**

Log into your [Apple developer account](https://developer.apple.com/account/) and go to the app's ID page. Enable the Associated Domains app service. Take note of your Prefix (bundle ID) and your ID (team ID) - you will need them later.

![associated_domains_team_id.png](https://support.singular.net/hc/article_attachments/13913960719643)

2. **Add Associated Domain Capability to Your Application**

Add the "Associated Domain" capability to your app in Xcode, and add your web servers' domain as an associated domain.

![domains.png](https://support.singular.net/hc/article_attachments/13913961122459)

3. **Configure the Web Server**   - _Create apple-app-site-association File_

        Using the Prefix and ID from your app page, configure a JSON formatted file like the following and host it on an HTTPS web domain that is accessible from the root.

        For example, if you own the "https://www.mycompanywebsite.com/domain", your JSON file should be accessible at the URL "https://www.mycompanywebsite.com/apple-app-site-association". Note that the hosted file does not contain a .json file extension.


        ```auto
        {
           "applinks":{
              "apps":[\
\
              ],
              "details":[\
                 {\
                    "appID":"A4GXBZ4XU7.my.cool.app",\
                    "paths":[\
                       "/page/all/",\
                       "/user/saved/*"\
                    ]\
                 }\
              ]
           }
        }
        ```


        The appID is your **\[teamID\].\[app bundle ID\]** and it identifies your app. The paths describe valid content pages in your app. Apple recommends keeping paths short. Use a wildcard ("\*") to specify all paths and use the "NOT" keyword to exclude paths, e.g. "NOT /user/saved/\*".

   - _Handle Universal Links Code_

     The final step is to make sure that any Universal Link that opens your app is handled correctly. To do so, implement the [application:continueUserActivity:restorationHandler:](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1623072-application?language=objc) method in your application delegate.


     ```auto
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
    continueUserActivity:(NSUserActivity *)userActivity
      restorationHandler:(void (^)(NSArray *_Nullable))restorationHandler {
if ([userActivity.activityType\
          isEqualToString:NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb]) {
    NSURL *url = userActivity.webpageURL;
    // Put code here to take user to relevant content}
    return YES;
}
```

How do I **enable Universal Links in Singular**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#enabling_universal_links_in_singular)

**Singular takes care of this automatically.** After you set up Universal Links for your iOS app, when you create a Singular Link for your app and enable deep linking, that link will automatically function as an iOS Universal Link - providing both deep linking and a mobile fallback.

Why do Universal Links sometimes **not work as tracking links**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#universal_links_limitations)

**Link Wrapping**

Link wrapping, where another link redirects to the Universal Link URL, often causes deep linking to fail (the user just gets taken to the mobile web page in their browser). This is because Apple wants “user intent” behind any rerouting, and a tracking link that redirects to another URL and results in deep linking is not considered direct user intent. Therefore, you cannot use Universal Links with partners who link-wrap an attribution tracker’s tracking link.

See [Which custom sources support deep linking and other Singular Links features?](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212#limitations_of_custom_sources)

**Tracking Without a “Click”**

If a user clicks on a tracking-enabled Universal Link, and it deep links the user into the app (because the app is installed), some attribution trackers may not be able to track this touchpoint because the device did not perform any HTTP request and therefore no “click” is registered.

Using Singular takes care of this problem for you, as Singular Links ensures complete acquisition and re-engagement tracking of both install links and deep links.

Which **partners** support deep linking with Singular Links?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#deep_linking_support)

**Note:** Deep linking with Singular requires special configuration in your Singular SDK/S2S integration. To learn more, see [Singular Links Prerequisites](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360031371451).

Deep linking support varies by partner. Some partners even require deep links for re-engagement campaigns since these campaigns target known existing users who already have the app.

**» Learn more in our**[**Deep Linking FAQ**](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360031370991)**.**

### Self-Attributing Network (SAN**SAN**: Self-attributing network: an ad network that makes attribution decisions for itself without the use of third-party MMPs. SAN campaigns do not use Singular tracking links. Also called "Self-reporting network" (SRN). e.g. Facebook, Snapchat, Apple Search Ads.) Partners

Self-attributing partners such as Facebook and Google Ads do not support tracking links for mobile app campaigns. To configure deep links with these partners, you need to use the partner's dashboard, and you may have to configure your app according to the partner's instructions.

Learn more about deep linking with the following self-attributing partners:

- [Facebook (aka Meta)](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-ads/deep-linking/)
- [Google Ads](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6046977?hl=en)
- [Snap Ads](https://businesshelp.snapchat.com/en-US/article/deeplink-specs)
- [X Ads (formerly Twitter - App Cards)](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/app-card)

For more information, we recommend reaching out to your partner contact.

### Non-Self-Attributing Partners

Some partners in this category do not use MMP**MMP**: A mobile measurement partner is a service that helps brands and apps measure marketing campaign performance across all their sources and channels. Used interchangeably with "tracker" or "attribution provider". [Learn more](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/115000526963-Understanding-Singular-Mobile-App-Attribution) tracking links for redirects or deep links. Instead, Singular receives the click notification asynchronously. These partners are also known as [server-to-server or asynchronously integrated partners](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360012249992#Server-Side_Asynchronous_Attribution), and deep links can generally be configured in the partner campaign dashboard.

For non-self-attributing partners that support tracking link redirects for mobile app campaigns, Singular Links may be used to deliver the deep link experience when engaging users who already have your app installed.

**Note for iOS Apps:** While deep linking with [Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/) is the preferred method on iOS, it has its [limitations](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360031371191#universal_links_limitations). Singular Links that are generated with a deep link destination will always attempt to use Universal Links to deep link. However, a fallback option (force redirect) is available if your iOS app supports traditional [app scheme deep links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/inter-process_communication/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/defining_a_custom_url_scheme_for_your_app). This is used if the partner doesn't support Universal Link deep linking.

Which partners support DEFERRED deep linking with Singular Links?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#deferred_deep_linking_support)

Deferred deep linking with Singular requires certain prerequisites with your SDK (or S2S) implementation with Singular (see [Singular Links Prerequisites](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360031371451)).

We recommend adding deferred deep links when a campaign is using deep links.

Note that just like with deep links, deferred deep links setup differs between self-attributing and non-self-attributing partners.

### Self-Attributing Partners

Self-attributing partners such as Facebook and Google Ads do not support tracking links for mobile app campaigns. Therefore, deep linking and deferred deep linking are configured in the partner's dashboard and may require partner-specific app handling requirements. Deferred deep linking with self-attributing networks is built into the MMP integration itself with partners that support deferred deep linking in the integration.

Singular supports deferred deep linking with:

- **Facebook** ( [read more](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-ads/deep-linking/#deferred-deep-linking)). To enable deferred deep linking through Singular, contact your Singular Customer Success Manager. Make sure the equivalent functionality is **not** enabled in the Facebook SDK.
- **Snapchat**: Automatically enabled with an activated Partner Configuration.
- **Google Ads:** Automatically enabled with an activated Partner Configuration.
- **TikTok Ads:** Automatically enabled with an activated Partner Configuration. See [TikTok's help center article on enabling deferred deep linking with supported campaign objectives](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/understanding-deeplinks-and-deferred-deeplinks?lang=en#anchor-5).

Reach out to your Singular customer success manager to inquire about deferred deep linking possibilities for more self-attributing networks in the works.

### Non-Self-Attributing Partners

Deferred deep linking with any non-self-attributing partner can be enabled and used with any of these partners simply by configuring the deferred deep link value for the Singular Link. Unlike deep links, deferred deep linking is not dependent on partner redirects and is a feature enabled via your integrations with Singular's SDK (or S2S API).

## Creating Singular Links

What is a **Link Domain**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#what_is_a_link_sub_domain)

Singular tracking links have the following structure, where \[SUBDOMAIN\] is chosen by you, and \[DNS\_ZONE\] is "sng.link". Together, the subdomain and the DNS zone make up the domain.

![Screen_Shot_2023-01-24_at_16.02.07.png](https://support.singular.net/hc/article_attachments/12306073181467)

You can create a single domain and use it for all your links, or you can create several to use for different purposes. You have to create at least one domain.

![Screen_Shot_2021-12-05_at_12.14.53.png](https://support.singular.net/hc/article_attachments/4412022259739)

**Example:**

For a campaign that markets an app called Jewel Rush, you can create the domain **"jewelrush.sng.link"**. Then you can use it to create tracking links with the following structure:

```auto
https://jewelrush.sng.link/[PARAMETERS]
```

**Note:** Currently, We do not allow passing special characters such as -,$,! in the Link Sub Domains. As a best practice, Create a Link Sub Domain without special characters.

Any Sub Domains are created with special characters, You can star and archive your domains by hovering over them. If you archive a link domain, you'll be prompted to confirm your action.

![archive_linkdomain.png](https://support.singular.net/hc/article_attachments/15427315586971)

What is the **Link Type**? What is the difference between **Partner** links and **Custom Source**Source**: In Singular reporting, a source is an ad network or other third-party platform in which you advertised your product.** links?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#what_is_the_link_type)

**Partners** are ad networks and other services that are integrated with Singular's attribution tracker.

When you create a Partner link, Singular automates some of the process by:

- Displaying only the **options that are supported by that partner**. For example, some partners support only iOS or only Android.
- Generating the **tracking link** with partner macros that allow the partner to pass campaign information to Singular.

**Custom Sources** are self-owned or self-managed marketing channels such as email or SMS campaigns, social media, and cross-promotion campaigns.

**Note:** If you are working with an email service provider, create a Partner tracking link. If you manage your own email campaigns, create a Custom tracking link.

Why isn't Facebook/X Ads (Twitter) in the Source Name dropdown?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#why_isnt_facebook_twitter_in_source_name_dropdown)

Self-Attributing Networks such as Facebook and X Ads do not use Singular tracking links. To configure them, see the instructions in:

- [Facebook Ads Attribution Integration](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/115003252706)
- [Google Ads (AdWords) Attribution Integration](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/115003252786)
- [X (Twitter) Ads Attribution Integration](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360003123352)
- Or find the SAN's guide in the [Partner Integrations in Detail](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/sections/360000631472) section.

What is the **Tracking Link Name**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#what_is_the_tracking_link_name)

![Screen_Shot_2019-07-30_at_16.17.14.png](https://support.singular.net/hc/article_attachments/360034543452)

This is just a name you give your tracking link, and it can be whatever you want (although most users use the campaign name or a variation of the campaign name).

The Tracking Link Name will appear in your reports as "Tracker Name."

Can I use the same tracking link for **iOS and Android**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#same_tracking_link_ios_and_android)

You can sometimes - depending on the partner.

- Some partners support **only iOS or only Android**.
- Others support **both platforms** but require you to create a separate link for each.
- Finally, some partners allow you to create **multi-platform links**, where you create one tracking link for use with both platforms.

The **Create Link** page displays the options that are supported by the partner you have selected.

**Note:** To make your link available for a certain platform, you first have to set up your app for that platform (add an app site) in Singular's **Apps Configuration** page.

What is **re-engagement**? How do I configure a Singular Link for re-engagement/retargeting?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#what_is_re_engagement)

Re-engagement is the renewed use of a product by a user who has already been converted in the past. Campaigns that aim to create re-engagement are called retargeting campaigns.

To have Singular track re-engagement, you just need to enable re-engagement tracking when you create the Singular Link(s) used in the campaign. Expand the **Attribution Settings** section and select **Enable Re-engagement Tracking.**

**![unnamed.png](https://support.singular.net/hc/article_attachments/360075051012)**

**Note:** Not all partners support this type of marketing campaign.

What's the difference between **deterministic** and **probabilistic** clicks/views?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#deterministic_vs_fingerprinted_clicks_and_views)

**Deterministic**Deterministic**: Deterministic attribution is attribution performed based on a device identifier. [Learn more](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/115000526963-Understanding-Singular-Mobile-App-Attribution#Singular_Attribution_Methods) clicks/views** are attributed to a source based on a device identifier or Google Install Referrer.

**Probabilistic clicks/views** are attributed based on a combination of various properties that Singular gathers about the user's device in the absence of a device ID. Probabilistic attribution methods are only available for Android devices. Apple prohibits the use of probabilistic methods on iOS devices ( [see here](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/#:~:text=Can%20I%20fingerprint%20or%20use,rejected%20from%20the%20App%20Store.)).

**» For more information, see**[**Singular Attribution Methods**](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/115000526963#Attribution_Methods)**.**

How do I change the **attribution lookback window** for a link?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#attribution_windows)

By default, tracking links use the default lookback window configured for the partner in the **Partner Configuration** page. However, you can override the default lookback window and customize it for each individual link by selecting **Override attribution windows** under **Attribution Settings**.

This allows greater control for partners with different types of channels that can benefit from varying attribution windows.

**» See**[**The Attribution Lookback Window**](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/115000526963#The_Attribution_Lookback_Window)**for more information.**

How can I create a tracking link with a **shorter URL**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#how_to_shorten_url)

**Note:** Link shortening is available for [custom links only](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212#what_is_the_link_type).

After you click **Generate** and see the tracking link URL, you can select **Shorten Link** to create a shorter version of the same link. This is useful for custom channels where the URL is exposed to the end-user, or for channels with restrictions on the length of the URL, such as SMS.

![screenshot-app.singular.net-2019.10.10-17_48_43.png](https://support.singular.net/hc/article_attachments/360040762832)

**Tip:** Shortened links can also be used to update live campaigns without swapping out the tracking link.

For example, you may use a banner or landing page to track a regularly changing promotional offer. If you use a full-length Singular tracking link, you have to swap out the link whenever you want to change the promo details. If you use a shortened link instead, you can update the promo details from the Singular **Link Management** page (by changing the link parameters).

Starred apps are pinned to the top of the list in the **Link Management** page. This setting is customizable per user and saved for your next logins.

This means that if your organization has a large number of apps, you don't have to scroll through the whole list every time you want to create or manage Singular Links - you can quickly access the specific app(s) that you are working with.

The changes take effect as soon as you click **Save** in the **Edit Tracking Link** page.

If the link is already active in campaigns, any past clicks, impressions, and attributions belonging to these campaigns are not affected.

**Note:** We do not recommend editing live tracking links. The editing functionality is provided for adjusting settings or correcting mistakes in the campaign preparation stage. Editing a link after it's live may have unintended effects on attribution.

What happens to a link when I **archive** it?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#archiving_links)

When you archive a tracking link, that link is hidden from your tracking link dashboard. The purpose is to declutter your dashboard by hiding old links that belong to past campaigns.

We maintain a 30-day grace period for these links. After 30 days, archived links are permanently deleted from our servers and will stop working. We cannot restore links once they have been hard-deleted

**Note:** Archiving is not reversible!

I have created a lot of links. How can I **find a specific link** to view its information?

To search and filter your link list, use the search bar at the top left of the **Manage Links** page.

Just type in a tracking link URL (or a part of it), a link name, a source name, etc. The links that match your string will appear on the right under **Available Links**.

How do I pass **dynamic data** to the app through my Singular Link?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#passthroughs)

You can make the link do even more work by **adding data to it dynamically** as you display your ads. This data can then be read and used by your app if a user engages with one of the ads and then arrives into your app. To add dynamic data, append the **\_p** parameter and any value to the end of your Singular Link. **\_p** stands for "passthrough," and you can give it a URL-encoded JSON value or an unstructured string value.

**Example:** You have a shopping app and you show dynamic banner ads of different shoes on a mobile website. You have created a Singular Link that looks as follows: [https://myshoppingapp.sng.link/A59c0/nha7](https://myshoppingapp.sng.link/A59c0/nha7/)

When you display the ad, the specific pair of shoes shown has a product ID, e.g., "Shoes123". You append the product ID to your Singular Link using the "\_p" parameter. The result: [https://myshoppingapp.sng.link/A59c0/nha7?\_p=Shoes123](https://myshoppingapp.sng.link/A59c0/nha7?_p=Loafers123)

Whenever a user engages with that banner and then installs and opens the app, your app can read the product ID using the Singular SDK. Your app team can use this information to personalize the user's first app experience.

**JSON example:** You can build a JSON object as follows:

```auto
{
“productid”:”Shoes123”,
“qty”:1
}
```

Then you URL encode it and append it to the \_p parameter in your Singular tracking link:

```auto
https://myshoppingapp.sng.link/A59c0/nha7?_p=%7B%22productid%22%3A%22Shoes123%22%2C%22qty%22%3A1%7D
```

How do I use a **landing page** with Singular Links?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#landing_pages)

If you decide that a landing page is right for your campaign, and your campaign depends on a [mobile attribution provider](https://www.singular.net/mobile-attribution/) for tracking, first consider the following:

- Make sure there is a way for the user to convert to the app from the landing page.
- Consider the media channel you're working with. Integrated partners may support different methods to execute a landing page.

Then, decide which touchpoint you would like to attribute the install to.

1. **Tracking the click that takes the user to the landing page:** In this case, just use the Singular Link you generate in the **Link Management** page as usual and define the landing page as your Mobile Fallback URL.
2. **Tracking the click that the user engages with within the landing page:** If you choose this option, embed the Singular Link is in your landing page. Ensure the link from the ad to the landing page passes any necessary tracking values through to the landing page.

Which custom sources support deep linking and other Singular Links features?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#limitations_of_custom_sources)

You can use Singular Links to track your marketing efforts in self-owned channels such as social media or SMS. However, deep linking only works in some channels with some technologies.

We've compiled a list of known and common redirect limitations:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | **Android** | **iOS** |
|  | **Fallback to Google Play Store** | **Deep Link** | **Fallback to App Store** | **Deep Link** |

How can I add granularity, such as campaign-level data, when I use Singular Links with custom sources?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#granularity_parameters)

When you use Singular Links in custom sources, you can add dimension information to get that added granularity in your reports. For example, if you pass the campaign name in your tracking link, you will get campaign-level granularity in your report.

To pass the information, add it as a parameter to the link when you serve it. See the [**full list of tracking link reporting parameters**](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360018879491) supported by Singular. For example, the following link records the Campaign Name dimension as "CoolShoes123":

```auto
https://singularassist.sng.link/A59c0/u53f?_dl=singularassist%3A%2F%2F&_p=%7B%22productid%22%3A%22Shoes123%22%7D&pcn=CoolShoes123
```

How can I **dynamically modify redirects** for existing Singular Links?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#overriding_redirects)

You can override link redirects dynamically by adding **\_dl**, **\_ddl**, or other redirecting parameters to your Singular Link (see full table below). This can be useful, for example, if you're serving a dynamic deep link based on some input from the user, or in the context of the user engagement.

**Example:** You have a Singular Link originally created to deep link to myapp://homepage: [https://myshoppingapp.sng.link/A59c0/nha7?\_dl=myapp%3A%2F%2Fhomepage](https://myshoppingapp.sng.link/A59c0/nha7?_dl=myapp%3A%2F%2Fhomepage)

You want to use that same link, but deep link to myapp://registration in some cases. To achieve that, update the \_dl= to the new value and use the same link: [https://myshoppingapp.sng.link/A59c0/nha7?\_dl=myapp%3A%2F%2Fregistration](https://myshoppingapp.sng.link/A59c0/nha7?_dl=myapp%3A%2F%2Fregistration).

The following query parameters can be appended or modified as needed. Remember to [URL-encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) the value when appending it to a parameter.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Parameter** | **Description** |
| **\_dl** | Deep link for **all mobile platforms**. Note: Overriding/using this query parameter is only possible if the original link was enabled with deep linking. |
| **\_ddl** | Deferred deep link for **all mobile platforms**. Note: \_ddl can be enable deferred deep linking even if not enabled via the UI during creation. |
| **\_fallback\_redirect** | The fallback redirect for all platforms (web + any other platform). |
| **\_android\_dl** | Deep link for Android. This is typically used if your deep link URL on Android is different from your iOS app. |
| **\_android\_redirect** | Redirect URL if the app is not installed on Android. This is typically the app store URL. |
| **\_android\_ddl** | Deferred deep link for Android. This is typically used if your deep link URL on Android is different from your iOS app. Note: \_android\_ddl can be enable deferred deep linking even if not enabled via the UI during creation. |
| **\_ios\_dl** | Deep link for iOS. This is typically used if your deep link URL on iOS is different from your Android app. Note: Overriding/using this query parameter is only possible if the original link was enabled with iOS deep linking. |
| **\_ios\_redirect** | Redirect URL if the app is not installed on iOS. This is typically the app store URL. |
| **\_ios\_ddl** | Deferred deep link for iOS. This is typically used if your deep link URL on iOS is different from your Android app. Note: \_ios\_ddl can be enable deferred deep linking even if not enabled via the UI during creation. |
| **\_force\_redirect=1** | In cases where iOS Universal Links [may not deep link](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360031370991#what_causes_deep_linking_to_fail), appending **&\_force\_redirect=1** (or **&\_force\_redirect=true**) will enable the Singular Link to use app scheme-based deep linking to force the deep link to the end-user. <br>This is most commonly used to enable deep linking with partners, as link wrapping will break Universal Links.<br>Prerequisites: an [iOS app scheme has been configured for your app](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360031371451#ios_app_scheme) and the configured deep link value ( **\_dl**, **\_ios\_dl**) is using that app scheme.<br>A brief message or warning may be shown to the end-user, depending on the user's default browser. |

How can I **limit the destinations of dynamically modify redirects** for existing Singular Links?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#overriding_redirects_allowed_domains)

You can protect your links from malicious overriding by limiting the destination a link can lead to when the destination is dynamically modified (destination override using query parameters).

This is done in the **Manage Links** screen by clicking the **Manage Links Domains** and navigating to the **Allowed Override Domains** tab.

**In the Allowed Override Domains tab, you can choose one of the following:**

1. **"Allow all destination overrides"** \- no limitation on override link redirects.
2. **"Do not allow all destination overrides"** \- override link redirects are not possible.
3. **"Limit to allowed domains list"** \- override link redirects are not possible, except for the domains added to the allowed domains list.

**Important notes:**

- This limitation will only apply to the following parameters:
  - \_fallback\_redirect
  - \_android\_redirect
  - \_ios\_redirect
- All subdomains and paths for the entered domains will be allowed, as well as all protocols (http/s).
- If you wish to allow specific subdomains, you can add them to the list. Only this subdomain and its subdomains will be allowed.
- You cannot add specific path in a domain - all paths under the domain will be allowed.

**Example:**

You want to protect your links, and **only allow overrides to your site: "mysite.com"**.

1. Add this domain to the Allowed Override List.

Note: The Singular Link " **https://myshoppingapp.sng.link/A59c0/nha7**" is originally created to fallback to the app store.

**Successful Overrides:**

- https://myshoppingapp.sng.link/A59c0/nha7?\_fallback\_redirect=mysite.com
- https://myshoppingapp.sng.link/A59c0/nha7?\_fallback\_redirect=subdomain.mysite.com
- https://myshoppingapp.sng.link/A59c0/nha7?\_fallback\_redirect=mysite.com/article1

**Failed Overrides:**

- https://myshoppingapp.sng.link/A59c0/nha7?\_fallback\_redirect=notmysite.com
- https://myshoppingapp.sng.link/A59c0/nha7?\_fallback\_redirect=fakesite.com

I need my redirect destinations to receive the information that's in the Singular Link parameters. How can I make sure my **parameters are forwarded**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#forwarding)

Singular Links will automatically forward any **utm\_\*** or **referrer** parameters that are included in the link. This includes the **singular\_click\_ID**, which is a part of the **referrer** parameter value. (Additional **referrer=** values appended to a Singular Link will be appended to the referrer next to the **singular\_click\_ID**.)

Appending **&\_forward\_params** to a Singular Link will forward all appended parameters for explicit parameter forwarding.

- Set to 1 ( **&\_forward\_params=1**) to forward Singular Link parameters to the App Store and Web Fallback redirect destinations.
- Set to 2 ( **&\_forward\_params=2**) to forward Singular Link parameters to the All redirect destinations including the Deeplink.

**Examples:**

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Singular Link URL** | **Parameters Forwarded** | **Parameters Not Forwarded** |
| https://singularassist.sng.link/A59c0/nha7?<br>this\_is=not\_forwarded&<br>utm\_source=auto\_forwarded&<br>referrer=also\_auto\_forwarded | utm\_source=auto\_forwarded<br>referrer=singular\_click\_id%3D0910cac2-f496-467f-8163-dc2251f5e601%26also\_auto\_forwarded | this\_is=not\_forwarded |

How can I have a Singular Link redirect to an Apple App Store **custom product page**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#customproductpage)

Apple's URLs for custom product pages (see [Apple's documentation for this new feature](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/product-page/)) have an additional parameter denoting the product page ID. For example:

```auto
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664?ppid=76659d7a-d146-43d3-b6b8-b7a12f74bf6b
```

To use custom product pages in Singular Links, when you create the link, just set the iOS redirect to the desired product page instead of the default app store page. For example:

![Example of custom product page link](https://support.singular.net/hc/article_attachments/4412890824987)

Alternatively, use the override parameter **\_ios\_redirect**. For example:

```auto
_ios_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Ftestflight%2Fid899247664%3Fppid%3D76659d7a-d146-43d3-b6b8-b7a12f74bf6b
```

To customize **reporting** on install conversions for a custom product page, use any of the available [link campaign granularity parameters](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360018879491).

How can I have a Singular Link redirect to a Google Play Store **custom product page**?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#customproductpageandroid)

Google's URLs for custom store listings pages (see [Google's documentation for this feature](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9867158#zippy=)) have an additional parameter denoting the product page ID. For example:

```auto
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.singular.deviceassist2&listing=testcpp
```

To use custom product pages in Singular Links, when you create the link, just set the Android redirect to the desired product page instead of the default Play Store page. For example:

![Example of custom product page link](https://support.singular.net/hc/article_attachments/32445282337563)

After generating the Singular link, Append **&\_android\_force\_redirect=0** to the end of the tracking link, as shown below.

```auto
https://singularassist2.sng.link/F4nw9/l5ik?_dl=singular%3A%2F%2Ftestlink&_android_force_redirect=0
```

**Note:** Supporting this feature requires the implementation of Singular [Android App Links](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360031371451-Singular-Links-Prerequisites).

To customize **reporting** on install conversions for a custom product page, use any of the available [link campaign granularity parameters](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360018879491).

How do I generate **QR codes** for Singular Links?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#qr)

A QR code is generated for you automatically when you create **Custom source links**.

The QR code is available after you click **Generate**, under **Link Summary**.

QR is supported for both long and short links. You can download the QR code to use in various non-mobile-to-mobile campaigns, such as desktop-to-app or billboard-to-app. Singular provides the QR code in PNG and SVG formats.

![Screenshot_2023-03-12_at_13.02.08.png](https://support.singular.net/hc/article_attachments/13590152364187)

Are QR codes supported for Partner links?

[![Copy direct link](https://support.singular.net/hc/theming_assets/01HZPR0DD1YAE7DSJ3G46VHMXM)](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360030934212-Singular-Links-Tracking-Links-FAQ#qr_code_partner)

Since Partner links contain macros that are populated dynamically by the partner network, they do not support QR codes. QR codes are generated automatically when you create a Custom source link.
