Tracking link parameters play a crucial role in ensuring accurate data collection and attribution for ad network partners. Singular tracking links support a wide variety of parameters that allows ad networks to append valuable information about clicks and impressions. By populating these parameters, ad networks can pass critical data to Singular, enabling more precise measurement of campaign performance.

Once a tracking link is triggered, the Singular tracker processes the embedded parameters and utilizes them in various ways, such as:

- **Improving deterministic**Deterministic**: Deterministic attribution is attribution performed based on a device identifier. [Learn more](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/115000526963-Understanding-Singular-Mobile-App-Attribution#Singular_Attribution_Methods) or probabilistic**Probabilistic**: Probabilistic attribution is attribution based on device properties such as the IP address rather than a device identifier. It is less accurate than deterministic attribution and is not supported on iOS devices. [Learn more](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360002290752) attribution accuracy**
- **Enabling deeper campaign insights:** Any data about the campaign, sub campaign (ad group/ad set), creative, etc., is saved by the Singular tracker and used to provide additional breakdowns in aggregated reports and user-level logs ( [Export Logs and User-Level Data FAQ](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360001216992)).
- **Determining Singular Links redirect behavior:** Some parameters are used to determine how the tracking link behaves. These special parameters don't need to be populated by the network - they are added to the Singular Link when it is created by the customer in the Singular platform.

Tracking links are a key component of your integration as an integrated media source with Singular. They allow you to pass essential data about clicks and impressions, ensuring accurate attribution and campaign measurement. If your company also supports postbacks, be sure to review the [Postback Macros and Passthrough Parameters for Ad Networks](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/115004063323) section before you submit an integration request with Singular. Once you have gathered all the necessary details, you can [apply here](https://requests.singular.net/partnership_application) to be an integrated media source with Singular.
